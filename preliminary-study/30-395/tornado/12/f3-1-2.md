The issue description is:

```text
I had to modify _on_access_token so that it did not attempt to make a facebook_request to /me. With the code as it stands, I get this error:

TypeError: 'Future' object is not callable

However, removing that extra request fixes this, and I can use the access_token in the next part of my auth pipeline.
