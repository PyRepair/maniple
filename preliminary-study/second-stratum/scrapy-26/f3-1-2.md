Make this available:

class CustomHttpProxyMiddleware(object):
    ...

def main():
    settings = Settings({
        DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES{
            CustomHttpProxyMiddleware: 400    #! Here
        }
    })
    crawler = CrawlerProcess(settings)
    crawler.crawl(spider)
    crawler.start()
```

I totally dig this idea, but I also think this needs to be well thought-out or it could spell more trouble than it solves and be hard to deprecate and fix later.

My thoughts on the current proposal:

[addons] in scrapy.cfg would not provide any way to pass configuration settings. So we still need to modify settings.py for, say, the database connection parameters.
That doesn't look very portable.

Also, if two different addons expose or use the same settings, it gets ugly.
Say we have different addons, one with a MongoPipeline and one with a MongoQueue, which by chance both use the MONGO_COLLECTION setting name.

This is obviously already a problem, but I think with add-ons, people would more expect a "plug-and-play" system which "just works", and be less careful with checking individual addon-components for name clashes or dependency issues.

Unless addons should be expected to be configured prior to use, or only as a bundle for hardcoded configuration settings, I think we need another layer deep to have addons and their settings in the same place.
Maybe we can use a [addon_(name)] (or simply [(addon_name)]) ini setting which can then take multiple parameters.
These settings should be namespaced to the addon.
Example:

[httpcache] # (looking in python path, no settings)
#enabled = True # (does ini-style require a parameter to recognize the section?)
[mongodb_pipeline]
path = /path/to/mongodb_pipeline.py # (explicit path)
host = 'localhost'
port = 27017
These settings would then expand to (addon_name)_(setting), e.g. mongodb_pipeline_port or MONGODB_PIPELINE_PORT to prevent namespace clashes between addons.

(Would this copy settings on scrapyd deployment?)
Alternatively, maybe all the addon defining and configuration could be in settings.py, but I think it should be in a single place.
