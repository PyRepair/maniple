Operating system: Ubuntu Xenial (on Travis)
Python version: 3.6.8
Black version: 19.3b0
Does also happen on master: Haven't tested but when through the commits since the release. No commits seem to touch the codepath we're seeing here.

black crashes on certain system configurations due to multiprocessing. Here is the traceback we're seeing.

This only happens when running black on more than 1 file at a time. There should probably be an option (or codepath which tries to correct this issue) for serial execution.

On some virtualized environment you don't have access to /dev/shm which prevent the use of multi-processing. The most notable use case being AWS Lambda, where /dev/shm is simply not present.

A quick and dirty patch show that simply replacing https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/black.py#L544 by None
and removing this line https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/black.py#L559
permits black to run in AWS Lambda, which is a huge win in term of CI (as black fits perfectly the use for serverless, i.e short runtime, low memory consumption, triggered on specific event)

so it could be implemented either (or both) by providing a --no-parallel or by detecting that /dev/shm is not possible (I need to dig on how to do that) and in these case to not use the ProcessPoolExecutor

I can provide the pull request if it seems acceptable to you
```
