The issue description is:

```text
Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04.4
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: 18.4a2
Does also happen on master: I believe so

Doing black --diff path/to/foo.py results in:

--- foo.py  (original)
+++ foo.py  (formatted)
@@ -39,24 +39,21 @@
...
caused by the following two lines:

https://github.com/ambv/black/blob/f294cc272c3aa5b8d3cd35b9f9283721b7e458d8/black.py#L298-L299

IMO, Black should print the full path to each file it formats in --diff output to be consistent with the behaviour of other diff-producing programs. Not printing the full path also makes it hard to read several concatenated diffs (especially when filenames are duplicated in different directories).
