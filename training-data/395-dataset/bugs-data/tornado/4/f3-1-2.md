The issue description is:

```text
When passing a negative range (example: bytes=-30720) in the Range header, but the requested file is smaller than the range requested, StaticFileHandler will try to seek to a negative position in the file and get an error from the operating system (linux in my case).

Traceback (most recent call last):

OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument
The code (file web.py around line 2494 in Tornado 5.1.1):

            if start is not None and start < 0:
                start += size
is not sufficient, it should check if size is smaller than start and in that case just set start=size.
```
