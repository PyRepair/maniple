The issue description is:

```text
Tornado version: 5.1.1

Running the following code causes RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache

from tornado import httpclient


def f():
    pass


c = httpclient.HTTPClient()
Error log:

Exception ignored in: <bound method HTTPClient.__del__ of <tornado.httpclient.HTTPClient object at 0x7fef4def84a8>>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/████/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/httpclient.py", line 99, in __del__
  File "/████/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/httpclient.py", line 104, in close

  File "/████/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/httpclient.py", line 220, in close
RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache
Since the error is ignored, it may be harmless to the program. But the error message may confuse some new users, so I think it should be fixed.
```
