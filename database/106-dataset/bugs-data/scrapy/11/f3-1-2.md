The issue description is:

```text
Access the text page(not mine) by browsers or wget and you will find the response content is not duplicate, but scrapy's response.body is duplicate. I had tried set the scrapy's headers same as a real brower's, but it is still duplicate.

Just use the follow sample code, and you will find the issue.

scrapy shell "http://files.qidian.com/Author4/3615059/88542882.txt"
Sorry for my bad english.
