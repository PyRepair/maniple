The issue in the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that it doesn't correctly handle the cases where `current_line` is a decorator, definition, or class. It also doesn't correctly handle the cases where the previous line is a decorator, definition, or class.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth!= self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```
The changes I made include:

* Correctly handling the cases where `current_line` is a decorator, definition, or class.
* Correctly handling the cases where the previous line is a decorator, definition, or class.
* Fixing the logic for determining the number of new lines to return.

Note that I didn't change the logic for handling the `previous_defs` list, as it seemed to be correct. If you want to change it, please let me know.
