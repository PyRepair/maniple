## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    
```

## A test function that the buggy function fails
```python
# The relative path of the failing test file: tornado/test/ioloop_test.py

    def test_force_current(self):
        self.io_loop = IOLoop(make_current=True)
        self.assertIs(self.io_loop, IOLoop.current())
        with self.assertRaises(RuntimeError):
            # A second make_current=True construction cannot succeed.
            IOLoop(make_current=True)
        # current() was not affected by the failed construction.
        self.assertIs(self.io_loop, IOLoop.current())
```




## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
line 252, IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None。why then raise "already exists"?
```
