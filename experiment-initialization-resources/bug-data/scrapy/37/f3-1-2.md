I stumbled on some weird issue, spider got some invalid url, but instead of crashing loudly when trying to create scrapy.Request() with invalid url it just silently ignored this error. Sample to reproduce

from scrapy.spiders import Spider
from scrapy import Request


class DmozSpider(Spider):
    name = "dmoz"
    allowed_domains = ["dmoz.org"]
    start_urls = [
        "http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Languages/Python/Books/",
    ]

    def parse(self, response):
        invalid_url = "/container.productlist.productslist.productthumbnail.articledetaillink.layerlink:open-layer/0/CLASSIC/-1/WEB$007cARBO$007c13263065/null$007cDisplay$0020Product$002f111499$002fAil$0020blanc$007c?t:ac=13263065"
        yield Request(invalid_url)
this generates following output:

2017-02-09 12:21:04 [scrapy.core.engine] INFO: Spider opened
2017-02-09 12:21:04 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 0 pages (at 0 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)

2017-02-09 12:21:04 [scrapy.core.engine] INFO: Closing spider (finished)
there is no information about trying to generate this Request with invalid_url, no stacktrace, no error info from middleware. Why?
```
