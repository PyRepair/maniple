There is a bug in the from_config method of the Keras Network class. This bug occurs when loading a model from a config when the model uses a layer that is shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file.

For example, the following model creates a single dense layer then applies it to the reshaped input x2. It is then applied to the non-reshaped input x1, and again at the reshaped output.

sl = Dense(12)

x2 = Input((1, 12))
r2 = Reshape((12,))(x2)
r21 = sl(r2)

x1 = Input((1, 12))
r1 = Reshape((12,))(sl(x1))

r11 = sl(r1)
c1 = Concatenate()([r11, r21])
o1 = Dense(2)(c1)
The layers of the model are as follows:

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                    Output Shape         Param #     Connected to
==================================================================================================
input_2 (InputLayer)            (None, 1, 12)        0
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

                                                                 input_2[0][0]
                                                                 reshape_2[0][0]

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
reshape_1 (Reshape)             (None, 12)           0           input_1[0][0]
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

                                                                 dense_1[0][0]
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
dense_2 (Dense)                 (None, 2)            50          concatenate_1[0][0]
==================================================================================================
Note that the dense_2 layer has reshape_1 and reshape_2 as inputs but those layers come after dense_2 in the list of layers.

The code in keras/engine/network.py contains the from_config method that loads the model. Then loading, the layer order of above is followed when recreating the model. At each layer Keras attempts to deserialize the layer using the inputs. When trying to deserialize the dense_2 layer Keras tries to create the first output but cannot because the input layers reshape_1 aren't available, Keras next tries to create the second output using input_2 which works because these layers are available. Keras will re-queue the first node (and third node) and will creates it at the next attempt when the input layers are available, unfortunately in doing this it swaps the output order of the output nodes of the dense_2 layer. The model loading then fails at the concatenate_1 layer as it uses the output nodes [0] and [2] of dense_2 but the output node [0] is now from input_2 which has the incorrect shape.

Note that if we change the order that we apply the shared layer so that model layer order changes this bug can be avoided. The code to reproduce the bug including code to create the layers in an order that doesn't trigger the bug is on this gist:
